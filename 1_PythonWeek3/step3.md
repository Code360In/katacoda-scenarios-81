# Now it's your turn!

## Tuples

Task: create a tuple that contains the first names of at least 4 friends, and, by calling a function, loop through and print them off

Extra Task 1: use key-value pairs of first names and last names, and print off the last name of one of your friends using the key

Extra Task 2: repeat the original task, but instead of using a loop try to print off 4 names using a recursive function
