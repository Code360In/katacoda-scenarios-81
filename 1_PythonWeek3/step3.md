## Task 1 - Fizz Buzz

Create a function that takes a maximum value, and with that cycles from 0 through to the maximum value. It should then do the following:

1. If the current number is divisible by 3, it should print “Fizz”.
2. If it is divisible by 5, it should print “Buzz”.
3. If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should print “FizzBuzz”.
4. Otherwise, it should print the same number.

Can you use default values here?
Can you set a lower parameter and use keyword values?

## Task 2 - Tuples

Through the use of a tuple, create a list of car manufactures and use a loop within a function to print these.

Extra task: Can you use a nested tuple to also include the name of a car model?
