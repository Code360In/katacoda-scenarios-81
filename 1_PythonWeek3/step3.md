# Now it's your turn!

Open new Python file: functions.py{{open}}

Run Python file: `python functions.py`{{execute}}

## Task 1:

To begin, open a new python file by clicking the link above.

From there, create a list of all the things on your desk and use the correct loop to iterate through this list and print the values out.

## Task 2:

With your previous list, use create some logic so that you break the loop on a certain item.

## Task 3 - Fizz Buzz

Create a function that takes a maximum value, and with that cycles from 0 through to the maximum value. It should then do the following:

1. If the current number is divisible by 3, it should print “Fizz”.
2. If it is divisible by 5, it should print “Buzz”.
3. If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should print “FizzBuzz”.
4. Otherwise, it should print the same number.

Can you use default values here?
Can you set a lower parameter and use keyword values?

## Task 4 - Tuples

Through the use of a tuple, create a list of car manufactures and use a loop within a function to print these.

Extra task: Can you use a nested tuple to also include the name of a car model?
