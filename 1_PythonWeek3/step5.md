## The big task - Classes!

Open new Python file: `classes.py`{{open}}

### Instructions:

This task is split into two:

1. Create a class called `Pet` and give it some variables (name, age, favourie food etc)
2. Create a new class called `Dog` and inherit from the `Pet` class 
3. Add some extra variables that are more specific to dogs - for example favorite toy or walk

Can you create some methods for each class?
