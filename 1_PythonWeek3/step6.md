## Why do we use functions?

Today, virtually all programming languages support user generated functions. But why are they useful?

Well, suppose you are writing some code that changes the background colour of a page everytime you click a button. If you wanted to change to ten different colours, this would mean having to write the same line of code ten times. With a function, we only have to do it once! The benefits of this, other than making your code neat is that if the code needs to be changed, we only need to change it once rather than ten times.

## The do not repeat yourself (DRY) principle!
In computer science, we have a principle called Do Not Repeat Yourself which is aimed at reducing the levels of repetitive code. The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system".

## Splitting the task up:
The other benefit of functions is that we can split a task up into multiple functions, and have this called by one function. This means that we don't need to have a massive function with hundreds of lines of code. We could have 4 functions with 25 lines of code for example that gets called by one function.
