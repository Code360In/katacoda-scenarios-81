# Week 1 notes

## Intro
- Use this as backup in case Katacoda dies on the day https://replit.com/languages/python3

- Don't hesistate to ask us for help. Google is your friend - emphasise that coders Google all the time so it's normal.

- Why we are teaching Python and what you can do with it, add examples of our own work. Show people how flexible Python can be.

    - Ellie's Tkinter GUI
    - [Perry's/ Alex's/ Alex's Spotify Timer Flask App](https://github.com/perryliuofficial/MusicTimerForSpotify)

- Have a quick summary of the 4 weeks, what we will be covering and what it leads up to.

- If attendees provide an answer, give them the opportunity to explain as well if they want to make it more interactive.

- Add Katacoda sign-on instructions into teams chat during session.

## 1. Variables
- Imagine it's a folder on your computer, where you can create new folders or files. Simply type code into our .py file (like how image files end in .png or .jpg) and then run it via the Terminal.
- Explain print(), the square brackets, and adding variables in between those brackets.
- Emphasise the practical uses of variables.
- \# Explain code comments.
- Focus on the page that explains how Katacoda works vs Python elsewhere
- For the page with instructions on how to install/run Python outisde Katacoda, let attendees know that it exists.
- Mention that they can use ```clear``` to clear the terminal.
- Encourage participants to edit the code/ variable values.



## 2. Strings
You'll be assigning strings to variables and using input(). Emphasise the practical uses part.

## 3. Numbers
Numbers manipulation. Get them to try print(0.1+0.2) to see why rounding is needed. Emphasise the practical uses part.

## 4. Comparision
Variable comparision. Briefly mention that in future sessions we'll be using if statements to ehance comparisions.

## 5. Practical Uses
Talk about Python uses in daily life/ work.

## Optional Reading
Try to find time to go through these two sections with the group. It's essential we convey the practical reasons as to why we're learning Python and to tell them what they can achieve.
