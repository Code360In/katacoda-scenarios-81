## Intro
Don't hesistate to ask us for help. Google is your friend.

## 1. Variables
To your right you can see a Terminal. For week 1 we'll be running code here. Simply type code into the Terminal and press enter, or click on one of the many dark grey code blocks to your left.
You'll be creating variables and manipulating it.

## 5. Practical Uses
