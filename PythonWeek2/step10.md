# Lists Exercises

## **Exercise 2a:**
You've learnt a lot about lists already, so let's solidify that learning by doing some exercises. We're going to start simple though first, you're going to write a list that contains some strings, you are going to edit one of the strings, add another string, sort the list and then delete an element. Below is a list of instructions to follow like you did in the previous exercise:

- Create a list of strings which contains some of the different nintendo consoles/devices: Switch, NES, Nintendo 64, PS5, Wii, DS.
- Edit the element "NES" to "SNES" instead
- Add a new element at the end of the list called "GameCube"
- Sort the list in ascending order
- Delete the element "PS5"

Hint: Use some of the previous methods/functions you have learnt to help you. If you need further help ask one of the instructors or ask in the teams chat.

## **Exercise 2b:**

Nested list exercise where you have to create a nested shopping list

Now we are going to move onto something a little bit more complicated, we're going to do similar to the previous exercise, but with nested lists instead. Below is some shopping lists data that we are going to work with.

Now do the following steps using the shopping list data provided and the knowledge you have gained about nested lists:

- Create a list that contains all of Lily's items 
- Make the list nested by adding the price of each item (i.e. have each item and its price in its own array)
- Create the same kind of nested list for Mike and for Tom
- Create an overall shoppingLists list with all 3 people's list within it

At this point you will have made a triple nested list, can you see how quickly things can become nested when you want to store associated data? That is why nested lists are important!

As further work you can do the following steps to explore nested lists:
- Retrieve the cost of Mike's Paninis
- Edit the cost of Tom's Milk to Â£1 instead
- Delete the Eggs array from Lily's shopping list
