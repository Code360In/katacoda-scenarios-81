## **Exercise 2:**

Now we're going to create some nested lists and work with them as practice. Below is some shopping lists data that we are going to work with.

Now do the following steps using the shopping list data provided and the knowledge you have gained about nested lists:

- Create a list that contains all of Lily's items 
- Sort the list of her items (in ascending order)
- Make the list nested by adding the price of each item (i.e. have each item and its price in its own array)
- Add this food item to Lily's shopping list: Chocolate - £1.50
- Create the same kind of nested list for Mike and for Tom
- Create an overall shoppingLists list with all 3 people's list within it

At this point you will have made a triple nested list, you can see how quickly things can become nested when you want to store associated data.

As further work you can do the following steps to explore nested lists:
- Retrieve the cost of Mike's Paninis
- Edit the cost of Tom's Milk to £1 instead
- Delete the Eggs array from Lily's shopping list
