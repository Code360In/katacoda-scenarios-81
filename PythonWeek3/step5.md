## The big task - Recursion!

Open new Python file: functions.py{{open}}

### Instructions:

Lets say, we need to create a countdown function.

We could do this by repeating the code over and over again, like so:

  `def countdown_fun(value):
    print(value)
    value--
     print(value)
    value--
     print(value)
    value--
     print(value)
    value--

    countdown_fun(50)
    `{{execute}}

However, this is really inefficient. Your task is to build this same system, but recursivley (where the function calls itself) to countdown from the inputted value to 0.
