First things first let's initialise Python by clicking on this here: `python`{{execute}}

You can store any value in a variable, then use it or change its value later on in the program. For example:

`myCardPin = 1234
a = 2`{{execute}}

Note: Variables are case sensitive.

We can print out the variables.

`print(myCardPin)`{{execute}}
`print(a)`{{execute}}

`print("hello my name is Sarah")`{{execute}}
