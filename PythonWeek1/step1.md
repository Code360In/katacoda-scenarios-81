# Initialise Python
First things first let's initialise Python by clicking on this here: `python`{{execute}}

# Basics
![Variables](./assets/variables.png)
You can store any value in a variable, then use it or change its value later on in the program. For example:

`myCardPin = 1234`{{execute}}
`a = 2`{{execute}}

Note: Variables are case sensitive.

We can print out the variables.

`print(myCardPin)`{{execute}}
`print(a)`{{execute}}

We can change the variables.

`myCardPin = 2222`{{execute}}
`myCardPin = 5555`{{execute}}
`myCardPin = 1382929292`{{execute}}

`print(myCardPin)`{{execute}}

# Strings
Strings are text in code. They can be declared in Python like so:

`foo = 'this is an example of a string'
email = "donotreply@vodafone.com"
`{{execute}}

The code above declares the variable 'foo' and assigns it the string 'this is an example of a string'. We can print foo out in python like so:

`print(foo)`{{execute}}
`print(email)`{{execute}}

We can also print out strings directly like so:

`print("I like trains!")`{{execute}}

Try it yourself using the terminal on the right.
