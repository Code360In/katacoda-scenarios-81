# Basics
![Variables](./assets/variables.png)

You can store any value in a variable, then use it or change its value later on in the program. For example:

`myCardPin = 1234`{{execute}}
`a = 2`{{execute}}

Note: Variables are case sensitive.

We can print out the variables.

`print(myCardPin)`{{execute}}
`print(a)`{{execute}}

We can assign a new value to an existing variable.

`myCardPin = 2222`{{execute}}
`myCardPin = 5555`{{execute}}
`myCardPin = 1382929292`{{execute}}

`print(myCardPin)`{{execute}}

✓ Valid variable names: ```_``` ```days_to_christmas``` ```Adiós_Señora```

✗ Invalid variable names: ```10t``` must begin with a letter ```Exchange Rate``` must not contain a space

Python also has a list of [reserved words](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp) that cannot be used as variable names.

# Strings
Strings are text in code. They can be declared in Python like so:

`foo = 'this is an example of a string'
email = "donotreply@vodafone.com"
`{{execute}}

The code above declares the variable 'foo' and assigns it the string 'this is an example of a string'. We can print foo out in python like so:

`print(foo)`{{execute}}
`print(email)`{{execute}}

We can also print out strings directly like so:

`print("I like trains!")`{{execute}}

You can print a new line using ```\n```.

`print("I like \n trains!")`{{execute}}

Try it yourself using the terminal on the right.
