# Practical Uses
Now you might be wondering: *What can I do with this knowledge?*

In future lessons, we'll be using the knowledge from this session to work on practical day to day problems.

Need to process and analyse lots of financial data? Python. Want to merge and manipulate multiple spreadsheets at the same time? Python. Looking to make video games? You can do that in Python! Always forget when bin day is? Create [bin day indicators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSBioki_03g) that light up with corresponding colours on the day!
