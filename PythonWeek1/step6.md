You now know the very basics of Python, hurray! *But how do I write and run Python code outside this course?*

# Let's explain the File Editor and Terminal on Katacoda
The Terminal is like the Command Prompt on your Windows computer. Using that, you can do everything that you can achieve via mouser and keyboard and more, from creating folders to changing computer settings.

For Week 1 we configured the Terminal to run Python. Katacoda has Python pre-installed within the system and we initialised Python within the Terminal for you by typing either ```python``` or ```py``` depending on the system. Now you can type and run Python code directly from the Terminal!

This will quickly become impractical as your code grows, so let's quit Python by typing this in the Terminal: `exit()`{{execute}}. If you want Python back refresh the page or type this: `python`{{execute}}
