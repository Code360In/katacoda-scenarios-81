## **Exercise 1a:**
You've learnt the basics of If and Else statements now, so lets see if you can write one yourself. Write a program that uses If, else and elif statements to tell the user it wants a certain number as input. Below is a list of things the program should do:
- print the sentence "No, I want a bigger number!" on the screen if the inputted number is less than 5
- print the sentence "This number is too big!" on the screen if the inputted number is greater than 10
- print the sentence "This number is just right!" on the screen if the inputted number is 7
- otherwise, print the sentence "This number is close, but still not right!" on the screen

To write your own code simply create a new Python file: `ifexercise.py`{{open}}

Write your code in the editor that has now opened and when you are ready, execute it with
`python ifexercise.py`{{execute}}
